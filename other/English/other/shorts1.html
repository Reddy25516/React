No matter what you do in your life make sure of 3 things. 
The 1st and most importantly irrespective of how big and small your goal might be into the world, make sure that you pursue it with sincerity and honesty. 
If you are sincere with your goal you will achieve it . 
The 2nd is that no matter how rich, powerful you might get true success is only achieved when you are good person at heart, 
so always make sure that you are a good human being.
And 3rd and most importantly be happy with what you have because there is no price to happiness. 
All of you should aim that you need to be happy irrespective of wherever you are working, whatever you are doing. 
happiness is the ultimate goal. 


***********************


Listen to everyone, take advices especially from your parents from your guides, from your teachers from people who are your well wishers but listen to all of them. 
At the end do what you want and I tell you why becuase once you do what you do and in coming future you succeed or you don't which is not in your hand , you will not have regrets and that's the beauty of life.


regrets : 
    to feel sorry that you did something or that you did not want to do something.

10 years ago, when I started working, All I thought about was how I would one day take over the world. How everyone everywhere would know who I am and how hard working and talented and and and intelligent and bright and flawless I am. 
Really I wanted to be perfect and I wanted the world to know it


flawless : 
    perfect; with no faults or mistakes.

12 rules of becoming the best version of yourself, so here are a few of my favorites from my list. There is only one you ok ? 
because there is no one like you and I don't mean the superfluous or superficial parts. I am talking about the core of you. 
who you are inside, your values, your beliefs, your flaws and once you understand who really that person is you would have made taken the first step in finding your unique self that is the best version of you. Who am I really ? 


superfluous :  flowing over the boundaries of what's needed
                more than is needed, desired, or required.

your beliefs 
your flaws 
your unique self

About 12 years ago , I came home from set early one day, she was sitting in my library and reading a book and she must have eight or nine years old, 
I know she love reading books. so I asked her. It's a weekday why aren't you in school ? and she said oh, I don't go to school anymore so I went and asked her mother and I said, you know why isn't she in school ?  and her mom said that her family couldn't afford to send her and her broher to school, so they chose the boy. 
The reason , she would eventually get married and it would be a waste of money, I was completely blown and it shook me to my core 
Eventually I decided to cover the cost of her education so that she could continue learn , because education is the basic human right. 


her family couldn't afford 
she would eventually get married

shook : 
    “Shook” is a slang term used to describe a state of shock, surprise, or astonishment. It is typically used when something unexpected or impactful happens that leaves a person feeling mentally shaken.

we've got plenty of languages in india. 

By the way do you live with your parents?, is that true ? yeah 
Ans is that common in india for older children to live with their parents ? 
It's fine to live with your parents because 
it's also common in india that we don't have to take appoinments with our parents to meet for dinner,so.

A guy asks his doctor , my girlfriend is pregnant but we always use protection and the rubber has never broken. How is that possible ? 
The doctor responds with let me tell you a story, there was one hunter who always carried a gun whereever he went.
one day he took out his umbrella instead of his gun and went out. A lion suddenly jumped infront of him. 
In order to scare the lion the hunter used the umbrealla like a gun and shot the lion , then it died. 
The guy responds nonsense!, someone else must have shot the lion. 
The doctor says good!, you understood the story

people who left india and gone elsewhere and why , because the environment here doesn't support them. 
I grow up in an environment where if you had an idea your boss or your manager politely told you and sometimes not so politely that you need to gain some experience before you open your mouth.
you need to roll up your sleeves and spend five years of shop floor. then you can talk. 
and that not what enterprises today, enterprise today is an ability of someone who may be in his 20s who has a good idea and he needs to find a way to implement them.


the environment here doesn't support them.

There are people all around, there are cars parked all around. There are people on the street , you look ahead, there are thousands of people, you look behind, there's thousands of people. And everybody had a smile on their face. None of them are sitting in the car, all of them were outside.
