when there's gonna be alliances,

-Yeah.
-Um, I do not associate with doctors.

And by removing them,
the followers will scramble,

I think everybody
have a sense of paranoia.

It's dangerous putting yourself
in the limelight in this place.

My biggest weakness
is making impulsive decisions,


I'm being impatient,

Even for the game.
I just can't stand it. I'm allergic to it.

I don't ... I mean,
I don't care to go first.

So anyone can take any little bitty thing
and hold a grudge against something,


I know I'm safe 'cause there's
a lot of people that people don't like.

you literally expose your vote,

that is 1 41
a huge disadvantage in this game.

You are guaranteeing
somebody is gonna be coming for you.

[374] Once I see my face go up
on that board with the first vote,

I know I'm toast.

That's so savage.

but I'm thinking about
who has been rude to me,
