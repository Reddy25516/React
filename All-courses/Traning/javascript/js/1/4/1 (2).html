    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write('<h1>heading</h1>');
    </script>

<!-- this will be displayed with heading1 -->

        <script>
            document.write('hello world')

    </body>
</html>

<!-- output is
hello world hello world

both here prints in same line

'here the script can be included any where in the program either in the head part or in
the body part
we can also include outside the <html>

--------------------------------------


to run a js file and html file 

we first need to create two files 
main.html and main.js 



# main.html file 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>my work</title>

        <script src="main.js">
            
        </script>
    </head>
</html>



# main.js file 

document.write('hello my name is reddy');


when we run main.html file

<!-- the output is
hello my name is reddy 

this is how we access the js file in html code
-->



statements are the instructions given to the computer to perform certain task.



<!--
    semicolon

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>my work</title>

        <script >
            document.write('hello'); 
            document.write('world');
        </script>
    </head>
</html>


<!-- here we can see that without semicolon we will get an error this is how semicolon helpful
when we try to write multiple statments in one line semicolon is used
-->

<script >
    document.write('hello') 
    document.write('world hii ')
</script>


'helloworld hii'

<!-- here this works properly without errors
bcoz we are writing it in multi lines-->





--------------------------------------




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>my work</title>

        <script >
            // this is the comment 
            <!-- here we can see that -->
            document.write('hello') 
            document.write('world hii ')
            
        </script>
    </head>
</html>

// this is the comment
<!-- this is the comment in html-->


<!-- 
here we can see inside script it acts as js
and outside script it acts as html

see those comments section 
-->
