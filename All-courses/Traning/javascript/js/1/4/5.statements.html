<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
    // let x, y, z;  // Statement 1
    x = 5;        // Statement 2
    y = 6;        // Statement 3
    z = x + y;    // Statement 4

    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "The value of z is " + z + ".";  
</script>

</body>
</html>




JavaScript Programs
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.





JavaScript Statements
JavaScript statements are composed of:

Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>

<p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are executed by the browser.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
</script>

</body>
</html>


output:
JavaScript Statements
In HTML, JavaScript statements are executed by the browser.
Hello Dolly.



Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.




Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:



<p id="demo1"></p>

<script>
let a, b, c;
a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = c;     // 11
</script>



-------


JavaScript White Space:
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.


code:


document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";




JavaScript Keywords
JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:

Keyword	Description:

var	Declares a variable

let	Declares a block variable

const	Declares a block constant

if	Marks a block of statements to be executed on a condition

switch	Marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases

for	Marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop

function	Declares a function

return	Exits a function
try	Implements error handling to a block of statements
JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.






<!-- JAVASCRIPT SYNTAX: -->

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:




<!-- JavaScript Values -->
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

    Fixed values
    Variable values

Fixed values are called Literals.
Variable values are called Variables.


<!-- JavaScript Literals -->
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:

1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:

10.50
1001




2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:

"John Doe"
'John Doe'



<!-- JavaScript Variables: -->

In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.

In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:

let x;
x = 6;




<!-- JavaScript Expressions: -->

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:
5 * 10

Expressions can also contain variable values:
x * 10

The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":
"John" + " " + "Doe"




<!-- JavaScript Keywords -->

JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.

The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>The <b>let</b> Keyword Creates Variables</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y;
</script>

</body>
</html>


<!--
output:
The let Keyword Creates Variables
110
-->



The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables:

<script>
    var x, y;
    x = 5 + 6;
    y = x * 10;
</script>




<!-- JavaScript Comments: -->

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.
Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:



<!--JavaScript is Case Sensitive:-->

All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 

The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:


<script>
    
let lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";   // here both are different

</script>




<!-- JavaScript and Camel Case: -->

Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

<!-- Hyphens: -->

first-name, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.

<!-- Underscore: -->

first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

<!-- Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case): -->

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

<!-- Lower Camel Case: -->

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.
