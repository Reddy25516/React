Variables:
are used to store data temporarily in the computer memory

Declaring variables:

<script>
    var name="reddy";
    console.log(name);
</script>

var is the keyword 
name is the variable 

it is upto us to whether delcare semicolon or not 
this is the way of declaring a varilble
console.log here is used to display in the console of the web page 

we cant start a variable with a number 
only underscore , numbers and alphabets are used in writing the name of the variable


camel case:
iAmReddy 

Pascal case :
IAmReddy 

snake case :
i_am_reddy

<!-- A variable provide us a named storage that our program can manipulate

    Variables are used to store information to be referenced & manipulated in a 
        computer program

    In programing , a variable is a value that  can change depending on conditions or 
        on information passed to the program

<!-- JavaScript Variables -->

4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const
Using nothing


<!-- What are Variables? -->

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

<script>

var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

</script>


In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword:

<script>

let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;

</script>




<!-- When to Use JavaScript var? -->

Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.
The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.




The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.
Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
Variables defined with let have Block Scope.


<!-- Cannot be Redeclared -->

Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.
You cannot accidentally redeclare a variable.

With let you can not do this:


<script>

let x = "John Doe";
let x = 0;
// SyntaxError: 'x' has already been declared

</script>


With var you can:

example:

<script>

var x = "John Doe";
var x = 0;

</script>




<!-- Declaring a JavaScript Variable -->

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:

var carName;

let carName;

After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).



To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:

carName = "Volvo";
You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it:


let carName = "Volvo";
In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it.


'========================================================================='




<script>

    <p id="demo"></p>
    let carName = "Volvo";
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
    
    </script>
    
    
    It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
    
    
    
    <!-- One Statement, Many Variables -->
    
    You can declare many variables in one statement.
    Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:
    
    
    <script>
        let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
    </script>
        
    
    
    <script>
    
    let person = "John Doe",
    carName = "Volvo",
    price = 200;
    
    </script>
    
    
    
    
    
    <!-- Value = undefined -->
    
    In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.
    
    A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
    The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:
    
    
    let carName;
    
    
    
    <!-- Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables -->
    
    If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
    The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:
    
    Example:
    
    <script>
    
    var carName = "Volvo";
    var carName;
    
    </script>
    
    
    
    <!-- Note -->
    
    You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
    
    This will not work:
    
    let carName = "Volvo";
    let carName;
