<!-- When to Use JavaScript const? -->

If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:


<script>

const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;

</script>



The two variables price1 and price2 are declared with the const keyword.
These are constant values and cannot be changed.
The variable total is declared with the let keyword.
This is a value that can be changed.
