<!-- 
   Naming Conventions:
-->

name of the identifier should not be the name of the keyword
first character in the identifier should be underscore (_) or dollar sign ($) 

sub sequent character may be digits , letters , underscore or dollar

No other special symbols are used other than this

varibles are case- sensitive 





<script >
    var var=19;  // error
    var @dh =89 // error
    var _cjd =92; // no error
    var _d*dk= 33 // error since no symbols should use
    var 8Jdl=38; // error since we should not start with number
</script>



<!-- even this works-->

<script >
num=3;
document.write(num)  // 3
</script>



<!-- JavaScript Identifiers -->

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.
Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).


The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names


<!-- The Assignment Operator -->

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.



The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript





<!-- JavaScript Dollar Sign $ -->

Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing $ are valid variable names:

Example
let $ = "Hello World";
let $$$ = 2;
let $myMoney = 5;



<!-- JavaScript Underscore (_) -->
Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:

Example
let _lastName = "Johnson";
let _x = 2;
let _100 = 5;
