<!-- JavaScript Comments -->


JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.


<!-- Single Line Comments -->

Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).


<script>

// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";

</script>


THis is how we give comments in JavaScript

<script>
    let x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
let y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2
</script>



<!-- Multi-line Comments -->

Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.



<script>

// this is how we give multi line commments

/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";

</script>
